# Databricks Assignment: ETL and API Ingestion

This project demonstrates a structured data engineering pipeline using **Databricks (Free Edition)** and **Delta Lake**, covering:

- Bronze → Silver → Gold layered ETL
- External API data ingestion
- Schema transformation, UDF usage, and Delta table writing

## Assignment 1: ETL Pipeline

### Step 1: Source to Bronze

- Read raw CSVs: `employee`, `department`, `country`
- Wrote them to:  
  ```
  /source_to_bronze/employee.csv  
  /source_to_bronze/department.csv  
  /source_to_bronze/country.csv  
  ```

### Step 2: Bronze to Silver

- Read CSVs with **custom schema**
- Converted column names from CamelCase → snake_case using UDF
- Added `load_date` column
- Wrote to Delta format:
  ```
  /silver/employee_info/dim_employee
  ```

### Step 3: Silver to Gold

- Read cleaned data from silver layer
- Performed analytics:
  - Salary by department (descending)
  - Employee count per department-country
  - Department-country mapping
  - Average age by department
- Added `at_load_date` column
- Wrote final fact table:
  ```
  /gold/employee/fact_employee
  ```

## Assignment 2: API Ingestion

### API Used:
`https://reqres.in/api/users?page=N`

### Pipeline Tasks:

- Fetched paginated user data until empty
- Dropped metadata fields:
  - `page`, `per_page`, `total`, `total_pages`, and `support`
- Flattened nested `data` structure
- Derived `site_address` from email (`reqres.in`)
- Added `load_date` for audit
- Wrote to Delta table:
  ```
  /Volumes/workspace/default/databricks_assignment/site_info/person_info
  ```

### Final Schema:

| Column        | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| id            | Integer |
| email         | String  |
| emp_name    | String  |
| avatar        | String  |
| site_address  | String  |
| load_date     | Date    |
